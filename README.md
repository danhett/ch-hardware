# Cornerhouse Scribbler

### Hardware Controller

This is a very simple Arduino sketch that controls the lights and motors embedded in the Scribbler installation, built for the Cornerhouse Manchester. 

The monitoring software (https://github.com/danhett/ch-hostapp) writes an image to a directory on the host machine, which is then picked up by an Automator behaviour that sends the image to be printed and also activates this logic. 

Diagrams and specs to follow once this project wraps up!
